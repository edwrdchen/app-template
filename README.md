# Point Count Application

Previous researchers have presented various viewpoints on the change in energy flow and biomass through time. The amount of shell material, skeletal grains, and the like would vary depending on the change in energy flow. To look into these differing viewpoints, we are trying to identify the percentage of skeletal grains in point counts as a function of time. To come closer to this goal, we correlate data-mined data points of geological strata and/or time periods with the skeletal/shell/fossil abundancies using R.
